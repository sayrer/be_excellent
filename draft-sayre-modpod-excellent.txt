1.  Introduction

   There is some informal text in this document, but the topic is
   serious.  If you find yourself about to send a message you might
   regret, consult this text first.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Policy

   Be Excellent To Each Other.  For an extensive explanation, refer to
   [EXCELLENT].

4.  Rules

   All day counts below are cumulative, and any of these actions may be
   appealed.

4.1.  0-12 days

   Anyone appointed to moderate an IETF mailing list (such as a WG
   chair, or an IETF list moderator) can prevent posting from anyone for
   twelve days, either through outright blocking or screening, with no
   transparency aside from informing the person being moderated.  The
   person appointed to moderate the list can send a message along the
   lines of "we've asked some people to take a break".  Everyone
   following closely will know anyway.

   Hopefully, this action will be used only for a day or two.  This
   capability is good, because there's no shame.  It is not to be used
   in "Last Call" situations, as those have a time limit as well.
   Twelve days might seem like a long time, but the policy is intended
   to cover all times of year.

   Anyone can start a blog, or CC an email to a non-IETF list.  There
   are many venues not subject to IETF moderation.

   It may be that the IETF audience's attention is being abused through
   IETF infrastructure, so that's why this action exists.

4.2.  12-24 days

   The moderator or WG chair must inform an Area Director or the IETF
   Chair, as appropriate, and again inform the participant.

4.3.  24-36 days

   If the problem persists this long, it is in BCP 83 or IETF Ombudsman
   territory (ED: the WG will have newer refs here), which quite likely
   might have started in the previous steps.  At this point, it must be
   publicly pointed out.

5.  Sympathy for the Devil

   The hazard in writing any document of this sort is that it seems to
   presume the authors and supporters are perfect.  They are not.

   William Shakespeare notes this problem: "Hoist with his own petard".
   This phrase is archaic.  It means a bomb-maker has been blown up by
   his own bomb.

   Everyone makes mistakes.  The IETF will treat people with kindness
   and grace, but not endless patience.

6.  Security Considerations

   One problem with failing to be excellent to each other is that people
   wander off.  Then, documents don't get the security review they
   require.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
