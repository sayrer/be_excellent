1.  Introduction

   There is some informal text in this document, but the topic is
   serious.  There are also procedural rules at the end of the document.
   If you find yourself about to send a message you might regret,
   consult this text first.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Be Excellent To Each Other

   As described in [EXCELLENT].

   Keanu Reeves:\

   "What does 'Be Excellent To Each Other' mean?"

   Alex Winter:\

   "You gotta add the second part, though.  It really is a two part
   thing, right?  It can't be the one without the other."

   Keanu Reeves:\

   "Right, and "party on, dudes.""

   "I think the sentiment of it is really just be the best person/human
   you can be.  And, if you do that, then you can party on.  You're
   going to be safe, you're going to be supported.  You're going to get
   the gift of giving, you're going to get the gift of receiving, you're
   going to get the gift of sharing."

   "We're just some humans on a rock in space.  It's kind of nice to
   promote that idea.  Give it a little 'bring it in' a little 'group
   hug'."

   Alex Winter:\

   "I've always interpreted those two sayings joined together the way
   they are as ...you know Bill & Ted is really about friendship, which
   means it's about community, which means it's about the
   interconnectness of people, and being compassionate about that
   interconnectedness."

   "I think, for me, that 'Bill & Ted' has always been about being
   compassionate to your fellows, but also engaging with life.  That's
   what the 'party on' part has always meant to me.  Just like, you can
   be compassionate, and still just live in isolation."

   "Bill & Ted are always, like, going out on to these adventures with,
   like, optimism, and hope, and positivity."

   "So, I think it's like be kind to your fellow man, but engage with
   the world, like be out in the world.  That's a really cool message, I
   think."

4.  Security Considerations

   One problem with failing to be excellent to each other is that people
   wander off.  Then, documents don't get the security review they
   require.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
