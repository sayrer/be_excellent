Abstract

   This issue is a bummer, and the IETF consensus is to hope such
   matters never come up.

1.  Introduction

   There is some informal text in this document, but the topic is
   serious.  There are also procedural rules at the end of the document.
   If you find yourself about to send a message you might regret,
   consult this text first.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Be Excellent To Each Other

   As described in [EXCELLENT].

   Keanu Reeves:

   "What does 'Be Excellent To Each Other' mean?"

   Alex Winter:

   "You gotta add the second part, though.  It really is a two part
   thing, right?  It can't be the one without the other."

   Keanu Reeves:

   "Right, and 'party on, dudes.'

   I think the sentiment of it is really just be the best person/human
   you can be.  And, if you do that, then you can party on.  You're
   going to be safe, you're going to be supported.  You're going to get
   the gift of giving, you're going to get the gift of receiving, you're
   going to get the gift of sharing."

   We're just some humans on a rock in space.  It's kind of nice to
   promote that idea.  Give it a little 'bring it in' a little 'group
   hug'."

   Alex Winter:

   "I've always interpreted those two sayings joined together the way
   they are as ...you know Bill & Ted is really about friendship, which
   means it's about community, which means it's about the
   interconnectness of people, and being compassionate about that
   interconnectedness.

   I think, for me, that 'Bill & Ted' has always been about being
   compassionate to your fellows, but also engaging with life.  That's
   what the 'party on' part has always meant to me.  Just like, you can
   be compassionate, and still just live in isolation."

   Bill & Ted are always, like, going out on to these adventures with,
   like, optimism, and hope, and positivity.

   So, I think it's like be kind to your fellow man, but engage with the
   world, like be out in the world.  That's a really cool message, I
   think."

4.  Intermission

   Does this document resemble "counting to 10" or "calming down"?  Yes,
   it does.

5.  Rules

   0-12 days: Anyone appointed to moderate an IETF mailing list (such as
   a WG chair, or an IETF list moderator) can prevent posting from
   anyone for twelve days, either through outright blocking or
   screening, with no transparency aside from informing the person being
   moderated.

   Hopefully, this action will be used only for a day or two.  This
   capability is good, because there's no shame.  It is not to be used
   in "Last Call" situations, as those have a time limit as well.
   Twelve days might seem like a long time, but the policy is intended
   to cover all times of year.  Anyone can start a blog, or CC an email
   to a non-IETF list.  Anyone is free to publish somewhere exempt from
   IETF moderation.  However, it may be that the IETF audience's
   attention is being abused through IETF infrastructure, so that's why
   this action exists.

   12-24 days: The moderator or WG chair must inform an Area Director or
   the IETF Chair, as appropriate, and again inform the participant.

   24-36 days: If the problem persists this long, it is in BCP 83 or
   IETF Ombudsman territory, which quite likely might have started in
   the previous steps.  At this point, it must be publicly pointed out.

6.  Security Considerations

   One problem with failing to be excellent to each other is that people
   wander off.  Then, documents don't get the security review they
   require.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
