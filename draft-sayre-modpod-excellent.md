--- abstract

This issue is a bummer, and the IETF consensus is to hope such matters never come up.

# Be Excellent To Each Other

As described in {{EXCELLENT}}.

Keanu Reeves\:

\"What does 'Be Excellent To Each Other' mean?\"

Alex Winter\:

\"You gotta add the second part, though. It really is a two part thing, right? It can't be the one without the other.\"

Keanu Reeves\:

\"Right, and 'party on, dudes.'

I think the sentiment of it is really just be the best person/human you can be. And, if you do that, then you can party on. You're going to be safe, you're going to be supported. You're going to get the gift of giving, you're going to get the gift of receiving, you're going to get the gift of sharing.\"

We're just some humans on a rock in space. It's kind of nice to promote that idea. Give it a little 'bring it in' a little 'group hug'.\"

Alex Winter\:

\"I've always interpreted those two sayings joined together the way they are as ...you know Bill & Ted is really about friendship, which means it's about community, which means it's about the interconnectness of people, and being compassionate about that interconnectedness.

I think, for me, that 'Bill & Ted' has always been about being compassionate to your fellows, but also engaging with life. That's what the 'party on' part has always meant to me. Just like, you can be compassionate, and still just live in isolation.\"

Bill & Ted are always, like, going out on to these adventures with, like, optimism, and hope, and positivity.

So, I think it's like be kind to your fellow man, but engage with the world, like be out in the world. That's a really cool message, I think.\"

# Intermission

Does this document resemble "counting to 10" or "calming down"? Yes, it does.

# Rules

0-12 days\: Anyone appointed to moderate an IETF mailing list (such as a WG chair, or an IETF list moderator) can prevent posting from anyone for twelve days, either through outright blocking or screening, with no transparency aside from informing the person being moderated.

Hopefully, this action will be used only for a day or two. This capability is good, because there's no shame. It is not to be used in "Last Call" situations, as those have a time limit as well. Twelve days might seem like a long time, but the policy is intended to cover all times of year. Anyone can start a blog, or CC an email to a non-IETF list. Anyone is free to publish somewhere exempt from IETF moderation. However, it may be that the IETF audience's attention is being abused through IETF infrastructure, so that's why this action exists.

12-24 days\: The moderator or WG chair must inform an Area Director or the IETF Chair, as appropriate, and again inform the participant.

24-36 days\: If the problem persists this long, it is in BCP 83 or IETF Ombudsman territory, which quite likely might have started in the previous steps. At this point, it must be publicly pointed out.

# Security Considerations

One problem with failing to be excellent to each other is that people wander off. Then, documents don't get the security review they require.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.
